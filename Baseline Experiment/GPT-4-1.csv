From the propositions, we know that Bob is thin and short, which means he is small. However, the propositions do not state that all small people are tiny, only that all little people are tiny. Since Bob is not described as little, we cannot conclude that he is tiny. Therefore, the statement ""Bob is not tiny"" is true.",0
